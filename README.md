# CODETECH-task-1
# House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

## Project Overview

### Project Title
**House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression**

### Objective
To develop a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on various features such as square footage, location, number of rooms, and other relevant attributes. The project aims to assist buyers, sellers, and real estate agencies in making data-driven decisions.

### Key Activities
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Gathered real estate datasets from reliable sources.
   - Cleaned and preprocessed the data for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Performed data visualization and statistical analysis to identify trends and correlations.
3. **Model Development**:
   - Implemented and trained a linear regression model.
   - Optimized the model for accuracy and robustness.
4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Assessed model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared values.
5. **Deployment and Documentation**:
   - Prepared the model for deployment and documented the entire process.

### Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**:
  - Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
  - Scikit-learn for machine learning and model evaluation.
